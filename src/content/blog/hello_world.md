## `whoami`

Hi! I'm Diego, a self-taught software engineer with 2+ years of experience, I
mainly focus on web development, but recently have leaned a bit towards DevOps
and cloud development. I started my journey with
[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and their course on HTML and CSS,
then moved on to the javascript one but didn't finish it. Although it's a great
resource it didn't quite fit my learning style. I then found out about
[cs50](https://www.edx.org/es/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)
and that's when I realized that I enjoyed software development, and haven't
stopped learning ever since!

Before I got into software development, I was an electrical engineering student
in the Universidad del Zulia, but couldn't finish my degree due to the
[humanitarian crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_refugee_crisis)
my home country was going through and I decided to emigrate in search of better
oportunities.

Although I didn't finish my degree, I still got a lot of math background from
it. I also got my first interaction with coding, a programming course I took in
the second semester taught in Fortran! It was the best grade I ever got in
college, maybe a premonition of sorts 😄.

## `echo $HOME`

I was born in Venezuela 🇻🇪, lived 4 years in Chile 🇨🇱, and finally settled back
in 2023 in Spain 🇪🇸.

## `uname -a`

Although I've used a lot more Technologies and languages, here are the ones that
I could call myself competent with:

## `cat my_learning_resources.txt`

Over the years I've used many different resources but here are some of the ones
I recommend in no particular order:

- [Midudev's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/midudev) The goat ❤️
- [Eloquent javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) Great book btw
- [FullStack open](https://fullstackopen.com/es/) Another great resource
- [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
  Pivotal resource on my journey
- [Leon's #100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) Excellent resource as well

And everything else was mostly me trying something new and reading the docs.

## `pwd`

I'm currently finishing a DevOps bootcamp at [boolean](https://boolean.cl) and
also preparing for a Google Cloud certification via the innovators
[get certified](https://cloud.google.com/innovators/getcertified?hl=en) program.
Other than that I'm still searching for my first official developer role.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I really appreciate it ❤️. If
you're interests are the same as mine, I plan on posting regularly here, who
knows, maybe you'll find things that will help you.

Until next time and happy coding! 🤘
